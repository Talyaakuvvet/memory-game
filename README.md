##Java Memory Game
This is a simple Java project for a beginner-level memory game. The game presents a grid of objects initially hidden, and the player's objective is to uncover pairs of matching objects by selecting their row and column positions. Once all pairs are found, the player guesses the order of the objects in the grid. The game evaluates the guess and determines if the player wins or loses based on the accuracy of the guess.

##Features
Grid-based memory game with object matching and guessing functionality.
Simple command-line interface for interaction.
Provides feedback on the accuracy of the player's guess.

##How to Run
Compile the Code: Make sure you have Java installed on your system. Compile the project.java file using any Java compiler.
javac project.java
Run the Program: Execute the compiled Java program.

#Follow Game Instructions: The game will prompt you to enter row and column positions to uncover objects in the grid. After uncovering all objects, you'll be asked to guess the order of the objects.

#End of Game: Based on your guess, the game will declare whether you win or lose.
